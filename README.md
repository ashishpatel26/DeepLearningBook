# DeepLearningBook
Study note for the book: http://www.deeplearningbook.org/
You may buy it here: https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1479694019&sr=1-1&keywords=deep+learning

## Why I write the note?
Sometimes, I feel it's too abstract that I don't know that I don't know.
The best way to know that I know is to use it, and tell somebody else.
If I am wrong, hope somebody could tell me.

## How to use it?
I use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) to launch [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) and using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for programs.

If you don't have the environment, you may install Python first, than install Anaconda. Jypyter Notebook should be included.
There are many useful packages for Python: (You will need these packages in day 1...)
- pip for package management
- numpy for numerical process
- matplotlib for output figures

## What I want to achieve?
If I could understand deep learning, I think any high school student could. My goal is to teach myself deep learning, and also teach at least one kid about deep learning.
